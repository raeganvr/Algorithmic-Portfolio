# Algorithmic Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of algorithmic solutions with detailed explanations, complexity analyses, and sample test cases. The aim is to document problem-solving approaches and techniques for a variety of algorithmic challenges. This is part of my ongoing journey to improve my skills in data structures, algorithms, and efficient coding practices.

## Project Structure
Solutions are organized into folders based on problem categories, such as:
- `Arrays`
- `Strings`
- `Dynamic Programming`
- `Data Structures`

Each folder contains solutions to problems related to that category. Each problem solution includes:
- A `.py`, `.java`, or other file with the code implementation.
- A corresponding `.md` file detailing the solution approach, intuition, complexity analysis, and example cases.

## Featured Solutions

Here are a few of the algorithmic solutions included in this repository:

### [Two Sum](./Arrays/two_sum.md)
Given an array of integers and a target integer, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. Solution includes:
- **Intuition**: Optimization from brute-force to hash map for constant time lookup.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time - $$O(n)$$, Space - $$O(n)$$.

### [Climbing Stairs](./Dynamic_Programming/climbing_stairs.md)
Solves a classic dynamic programming problem where each step can either be a single or double hop. Solution includes:
- **Intuition**: Fibonacci sequence application.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time - $$O(n)$$, Space - $$O(1)$$.

## Complexity Analysis
Each solution contains an analysis of both time and space complexity to highlight efficiency. The goal is to demonstrate both brute-force and optimized approaches when applicable and discuss the trade-offs between different methods.
